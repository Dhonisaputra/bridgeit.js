### Technical
* **Does my web app need to be HTML5 for BridgeIt to work?**  
  No, BridgeIt will work on all supported mobile platforms regardless of the HTML doctype version.
* **Does my web app have to be packaged or installed as an app to work with BridgeIt?**  
  No, BridgeIt is designed to work with pure web apps. 
* **Is BridgeIt compatible with other HTML5 or mobile web frameworks?**  
  Yes, we've designed BridgeIt to avoid any specific conflicts with other frameworks.
* **Does BridgeIt have any JavaScript dependencies?**  
  No, BridgeIt does not rely on any other JavaScript framework, not even jQuery. 
* **I'd like to use my own backend media storage service instead of api.bridgeit.mobi/echo. Can I?**  
  Yes, there is no inherent dependency in BridgeIt on api.bridgeit.mobi. You can roll your own, if you like. Just specify the postURL option in your bridgeit call.
* **What mobile platforms is BridgeIt supported on?**  
  Android, iOS, and Windows Phone 8.
* **Does the BridgeIt Utility application need to be installed on the device for my app to work?**  
  No, the BridgeIt Utility can be downloaded automatically when it is needed.
* **I don't know a thing about Objective C or the Android or Windows Phone 8 APIs. Will I be cursing this day later?**  
  No, absolutely no knowledge of the mobile platform APIs is required to take advantage of BridgeIt. If you can stick a simple JavaScript call on HTML tag, then you're good.  
* **Will the BridgeIt Utility App do anything tacky like promote in-app purchases or show ads to my users?**
  No, we want to make BridgeIt as seamless as possible. We do not want to come between you and your users. Ideally your users shouldn't notice BridgeIt at all.
