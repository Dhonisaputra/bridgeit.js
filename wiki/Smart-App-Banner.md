One approach to prompting users to download BridgeIt is to use the Smart App Banner on iOS:

      <meta name='apple-itunes-app' content="app-id=727736414, app-argument=icemobile://c=register&amp;r=./index.html"/>

However, in our testing we found that users either did not notice the banner, or wondered why the banner remained after BridgeIt was installed.  The Smart App Banner is therefore more appropriate when used with dynamic server-generated pages that can conditionally include the meta tag. For HTML5, the built-in BridgeIt installation dialogue is sufficient.
